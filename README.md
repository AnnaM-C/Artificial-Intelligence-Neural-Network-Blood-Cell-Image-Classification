# Artificial-Intelligence-Neural-Network-Blood-Cell-Image-Classification

## Project Overview
This project involves automating the classification of blood cell images using advanced machine learning techniques. Training is facilitated with a dataset containing 10,000 training images and 5,000 test images. The goal is to classify them into eight categories, including healthy cells and various diseases.

## The following objectives are emphasised: 
- Medical Context: Addressing the classification of blood cell images, crucial for diagnosing diseases and monitoring health.

- Algorithm Development: Designing and implementing machine learning models to accurately classify images based on their features.

- Performance Evaluation: Assessing model effectiveness through various metrics beyond accuracy, ensuring robust and reproducible results.

## Results
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven effective in handling the complexities of medical image classification, underscoring their suitability for this project. Participants are encouraged to explore different CNN architectures and parameter settings to optimize classification accuracy and model performance.
